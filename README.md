# Data_Cleaning_Project

In this project, data cleaning in MySQL involves a structured approach to enhance data quality and reliability through four primary steps:

1. **Removing Duplicates**: Initially, we identify and eliminate duplicate records within the dataset. Since there isn't a unique identifier readily available, we employ a method where each row is assigned a unique row number. This process ensures that each entry is distinct and prevents redundancy in the analysis.

2. **Standardizing Data**: Standardization aims to normalize the format of the data for consistency and accuracy. This involves removing extraneous spaces or characters from columns, ensuring uniformity across the dataset. By eliminating inconsistencies, such as leading or trailing spaces in text fields, we enhance data integrity and facilitate easier querying and analysis.

3. **Handling Null and Blank Values**: Null and blank values can introduce errors and inaccuracies into the analysis. To address this, we systematically identify and remove rows containing null or empty values across relevant columns. Alternatively, depending on the context, we may replace null values with appropriate placeholders or default values to maintain data completeness and usability.

4. **Removing Unwanted Columns**: As part of optimizing the dataset, we identify and exclude columns that are irrelevant or redundant for the analysis objectives. This step involves carefully evaluating each column's relevance to the project's goals and removing those that do not contribute meaningful insights. By reducing the dataset to essential variables, we streamline data processing and improve the efficiency of subsequent analytical tasks.

Overall, these data cleaning steps in MySQL are essential for ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and completeness of our dataset. By adhering to these practices, we enhance the reliability of the data analysis and enable informed decision-making based on trustworthy information.
